title: Thermal Design
uid: d51c2ce7-9538-4a50-20ef-88704b6e9faf
---

Thermal design concerns the maintenance of proper temperature, typically within a building, structure, vehicle, or device. We will focus on a convenient and important example, that of buildings such as on the MIT campus. Our emphasis will be that of energy usage due to wintertime space heating; treatments of summertime cooling are in many ways similar.

This unit has the following objectives:

*   To understand basic principles governing heat flow.
*   To learn some types of wall and window construction typical of residential and light commercial building construction as they relate to heat (and also moisture) flow.
*   To understand the basic principles of thermography, the operation of a thermal infrared camera, and the use of thermal IR imaging in evaluating building heat loss.
*   To conduct an engineering study of the thermal performance of an MIT building.

There will be one in-lab practical exercise and an engineering report:

1\. We will carry out a practical laboratory exercise in which we determine the heat flow characteristics of several types of construction. ({{% resource_link 37bedfd6-f4ea-1f9a-9c53-356954da7622 "PDF" %}})

2\. Each team will conduct and report on a Heat Loss Study of an MIT building or part thereof. ({{% resource_link e713f476-43d2-222e-7c56-604c2640328d "PDF" %}})

Thermography; Principles and Operation of Thermal Infrared Cameras

Introduce the thermal IR camera (FLIR) and its operation, show examples of remote sensing studies in the thermal IR region, including heat loss of buildings; detection of 'buried' features in roads, walls, etc; identification of overheating components; target identification; etc.
