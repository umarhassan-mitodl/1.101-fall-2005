[Trussworks](/ans7870/1/1.050/java/trussworks/index.html) — Trussworks allows users to easily create and analyze 2D structures using the Direct Stiffness Method. It models truss structures that can carry axial loads. The click and drag interface lets you input two-dimensional structures, but the program can take in and perform calculations for three-dimensional structures as well using a text based XML® input.
